"""
Question 1

You have a Data containing two records:"Quantity" and "Price per unit".
How would you use arithmetic operators to calculate the total cost for item, also calculate the total Cost ?
Product 1, Quantity=5, price per unit=Rs 250.
product 2 ,Quantity=25 ,price per unit=Rs 656.
product 3 ,Quantity=34 ,price per unit=Rs 274.
"""

# For Product 1
quantity_1 = 5
price_per_unit_1 = 250
total_price_product_1 =quantity_1 * price_per_unit_1
print(f"For the Product 1 the total price is {total_price_product_1} RS")

# For Product 2
quantity_2 = 25
price_per_unit_2 = 656
total_price_product_2 =quantity_2 * price_per_unit_2
print(f"For the Product 1 the total price is {total_price_product_2} RS")

# For Product 3
quantity_3 = 25
price_per_unit_3 = 656
total_price_product_3 =quantity_3 * price_per_unit_3
print(f"For the Product 1 the total price is {total_price_product_3} RS")
